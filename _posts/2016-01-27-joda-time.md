Joda-time is an open source library which replaces the built-in Java date and time classes.

> The built-in Java date and time classes prior to Java SE 8 had several problems, one of which is lack of thread-safety.
> It is a common programming error to create a singleton instance of java.text.SimpleDateFormat which is then shared by multiple threads.
> SimpleDateFormat is not thread-safe. Calling the format method should not alter the SimpleDateFormat state, but it does.
> As a result, threads may get incompletely formatted dates.
> In contrast, all of the core Joda-time classes are thread-safe and also immutable.
> Each class also contains documentation describing its thread safety. 

For new Java 8 projects it is recommended to use built-in [JDK8 java.time].
